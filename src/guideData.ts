        description: `
          Choosing between a modular kitchen and a civil (carpenter-made) kitchen is one of the most important decisions in home design.  
          - **Modular Kitchens**: Factory-made, precise, sleek, smart storage, easy assembly, modern look.  
          - **Civil Kitchens**: Built on-site, customizable, traditional, takes longer to complete.  
          - **Cost & Maintenance**: Modular kitchens have a higher upfront cost but lower maintenance, while civil kitchens can be budget-friendly initially but less efficient long-term.  
          This guide helps you choose the right kitchen based on your budget and lifestyle.

        description: `
          Choosing the right kitchen layout ensures efficiency and aesthetics.  

          **1. Straight-Line Kitchen** – Compact, ideal for studio apartments.  
          **2. L-Shaped Kitchen** – Space-efficient, open-plan homes.  
          **3. U-Shaped Kitchen** – Best for larger spaces, offers great storage.  
          **4. Parallel (Galley) Kitchen** – Works well in narrow kitchens.  
          **5. Island Kitchen** – Luxurious, adds workspace & dining area.  
          **6. Peninsula Kitchen** – Semi-open design, attached island.  
          **7. G-Shaped Kitchen** – Extended counter for extra space.  

          The best layout depends on space availability, household size, and cooking habits.

        description: `
          Selecting the right materials ensures durability and aesthetics.  

          - **Plywood**: Strong, moisture-resistant (best: BWP plywood).  
          - **MDF & HDF**: Cost-effective, smooth finish, less durable than plywood.  
          - **Particle Board**: Budget-friendly, but not very durable.  
          - **Stainless Steel**: Ultra-durable, modern, easy to maintain.  
          - **Natural Wood**: Luxury choice, but needs maintenance.  
          - **Glass & Acrylic**: Stylish cabinet options for a sleek look.  
          - **Granite & Quartz**: Durable, heat-resistant countertop materials.  

          A combination of these materials balances budget, durability, and aesthetics.

        description: `
          **Modular Kitchens** (Pre-made, factory precision)  
          ✅ Quick installation, great finishing, easy maintenance, space-efficient.  
          ❌ Higher cost, limited customization, requires professional setup.  

          **Custom Kitchens** (Built on-site, carpenter-made)  
          ✅ Fully customizable, budget flexibility, durable if made well.  
          ❌ Time-consuming, inconsistent finish, harder to repair.  

          Many homeowners mix both—modular cabinets with custom wooden touches.

          **1. Task Lighting** – Focused light for cooking (under-cabinet LEDs, pendant lights).  
          **2. Ambient Lighting** – General brightness (ceiling LEDs, track lights).  
          **3. Accent Lighting** – Adds aesthetics (cabinet LEDs, cove lighting).  
          **4. Decorative Lighting** – Style-enhancing (chandeliers, vintage bulbs).  

          **Lighting Tips**:  
          ✅ Use layered lighting (mix ambient, task, and accent).  
          ✅ Pick correct bulb temperatures (4000K–5000K for prep areas, 2700K–3000K for ambiance).  
          ✅ Install dimmers for adjustable brightness.  

          A well-lit kitchen enhances functionality and aesthetics!
